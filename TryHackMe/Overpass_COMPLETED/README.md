# Overpass

What happens when a group of broke Computer Science students try to make a password manager?
Obviously a perfect commercial success!

There is a TryHackMe subscription code hidden on this box. The first person to find and activate it will get a one month subscription for free! If you're already a subscriber, why not give the code to a friend?

- Trying to get some nmap scan in to know whats going on inside the machine.

- Looking around the website to see what i can find and interestingly theres a link to download the overpass password manager or something. I just downloaded it. let me go and play around with it.

- I downloaded the source code and encryption is done with rot47, interestingly i have a rot47 python script lying around :) might come in handy here too.

- i'm at a stand still don't know what to do next.
