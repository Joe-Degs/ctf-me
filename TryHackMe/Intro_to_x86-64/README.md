- Remember to download the gui for radare2 [Cutter](https://www.cutter.re)

- I've actually forgotten all the assembly i did recently. After like barely a month of trying it out. Assembly is unnecessarily difficult to process and understand fr!.

### Introduction.

- Entered the radare2 program. Now looking aroung trying to get familiar with the basic commands. The commands are easy too. One character commands.


### If-Statements

- this shit is unimaginable hard. I might have to build some foundational skills first. see you later x86-64 assembly challenge, have a good time on the interwebz.
