# Introduction to Research.

- Already done google dorking, so researching is on my finger tips. This weeks i plan to accumulate some mad streaks on the platform.

- when doing google research, be straight forward and ask questions with keywords of what exactly you want your answer to be about.

- Type less, take out articles like `(a, the, an)` just makes your life harder. like looking for the hash type microsoft uses on passwords? `hash type microsoft passwords`. The question only has keywords of what i want my answer to be about nothing more nothing less. Always try to make it simple as you can.

- `CVE` -> Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure.

- Knowing how to look for cves, cwes and other types of predeveloped exploits is a good skill of any developer. It all boils down to research, know how to look for stuff on the internet, be persistent in searching. Dont ever be a giver upper, though sometimes you need to up and leave somethings behind.

- Knowing how to find info on the linux man pages is a great skill for any body interested in using linux. If you cant search for info in man pages fuck you! you can't use it. Because googling stuff is a bit stressful sometimes and man pages provide a straight to the point type of info on the topics.

- Now the room is done. go and make hay motherfuckers!
