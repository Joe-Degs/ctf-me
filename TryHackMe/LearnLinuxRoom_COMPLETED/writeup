This room was fun and ahh not alot of work ill say.
Already knew most of the stuff before i decided to do it. But it helped practice again because its been a minute I engaged
of any type of ctf.
I pretty just sailed through the walkthrough.
I would like to join one of the beginner courses but damn aint got no dollars for that, wish i could get somebody to help me out :(

But for now i'll just concentrate on joining the free beginner hactivities and see wossop.
Might actually go back to playing erhhmm Bandit games again. Merhn those were fun and tedious times LOL!
Argghh picoCTF those motherfuckers want to kill me fr LOL, like the stage i'm at is brainbreaking hahah :D.
Experienced my first buffer overflow challenge and i flat run away hahah.

But basically i want to get good at basic web exploitations and then move on to the big'uns.
Its frustrating sometimes too. Especially if you're new to all this. Wish i knew somebody close to me who  plays CTFs.

but is it was fun playing this game thoo.
Wish to start another room soon enough.
