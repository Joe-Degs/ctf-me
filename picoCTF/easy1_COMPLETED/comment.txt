This is a vignere cipher challenge, took some time to realise it though lol.
the key is `SOLVECRYPTO` and the text `UFJKXQZQUNB`.
i spent some good amount of time googling before i realised it was something called a vigniere cipher.
you could get the flag using the `table.txt` in the directory or as i did some online decoder.
