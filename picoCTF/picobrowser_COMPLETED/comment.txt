This was amazing exercise, solved it without looking up any writeups
It was amazing hahaaa LOL

it was a simple one to change the user-agent of the client making the request to the webserver to picobrowser.
I achieved with curl after trying to do it fruitlessly with firefox

the command was 
	curl -H 'User-Agent':'picobrowser' https://whatever.web.com
