This challenge involved trying to get the metadata of an image file.

so i just cat the file and pipe through strings to get the string metadata on the file.

the flag was "picoCTF{s0_m3ta_3d6ced35}". Ohh the days i used to watch john hammond on youtube crack ctfs.
Take me back to those days my nigga.
