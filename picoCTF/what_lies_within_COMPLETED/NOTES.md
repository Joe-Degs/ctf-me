# What Lies Within

flag 
```
picoCTF{h1d1ng_1n_th3_b1t5}

This challenge was solved by looking up a write up. The photo was allegedly encoded with the flag.
So i found this online decoder that decoded the picture and spat out the flag and some random text.
This is called Stenograpy by the way.
Super cool i'll say but new to me.

WOOOO! i just discoverd this new tool `zsteg` that grabs all the hidden data in an image like wow!
